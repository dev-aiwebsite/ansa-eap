# ANSA EAP

ANSA EAP is a web application built with **Next.js** and **PostgreSQL**.

This repository contains the application code and the database schema required to run the project locally or in a fresh environment.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend / Backend**: Next.js  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18+  
- PostgreSQL 14+  
- npm / pnpm / yarn  
- `psql` and `pg_dump` available in your PATH  

---

### Third-Party Services

This project integrates with several third-party services to provide additional functionality:

- **Uploadcare** — used for handling file uploads and media management.  
- **Elastic Email** — used for sending transactional and notification emails.  

Make sure to configure the necessary environment variables for these services in your `.env` file, such as `UPLOADCARE_SECRET_KEY` for Uploadcare and `ELASTIC_API_KEY` for Elastic Email.

## Project Setup

### 1. Get the project files

Download the project ZIP file and extract it to a preferred location.  
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:

```bash
cd ansa-eap

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install

or

```bash
pnpm install

### 3. Database Setup

The database schema is provided as a **schema-only SQL file**.

#### a. Create the PostgreSQL user (if not exists)

If the user `ansaadmin` does not exist yet, run:

```bash
psql -U postgres

Inside the psql prompt:

```sql
-- Create the user
CREATE USER ansaadmin WITH PASSWORD 'welcometoansa2025';  -- ### If you replace the password, make sure to also update the DATABASE_URL inside .env file

-- Allow the user to create databases
ALTER USER ansaadmin CREATEDB;

-- Optional: for local development, allow superuser (be careful in production)
-- ALTER USER ansaadmin WITH SUPERUSER;

-- Exit psql
\q

#### b. Create the database

Create the database owned by `ansaadmin`:

```bash
createdb -U ansaadmin ansa_eap

> If you need to specify host or port:

```bash
createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U ansaadmin ansa_eap

#### c. Install the schema

Run the schema SQL file to create tables, enums, constraints, and indexes:

```bash
psql -U ansaadmin -d ansa_eap -f db/schema.sql

> No data is inserted during this step.

#### d. Verify the installation

Connect to the database:

```bash
psql -U ansaadmin -d ansa_eap

Inside `psql`, list all tables:

```sql
\dt

---

## Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://ansaadmin:welcometoansa2025@localhost:5432/ansa_eap

Adjust the values according to your local setup.

---

## Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

The app will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000

---

## Database Schema Management

The database schema is maintained in `db/schema.sql`.

To regenerate the schema from an existing database:

```bash
pg_dump --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges ansa_eap > db/schema.sql

---

## Notes
- The production environment is already in the project folder as .env.production. Use only this file for production — do not use .env.local.

- This setup installs schema only (no seed data).
- Schema changes should be documented and committed.
- Avoid committing real database credentials.
- PostgreSQL must be running before setup.
